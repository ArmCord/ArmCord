# FAQ
## 1. Will I get banned from using it?   

 -You are breaking Discord ToS since we are using Cumcord for themes and plugins. But no one ever got banned from using ArmCord or Cumcord. If you wish to remove Cumcord, you can find it in your mods folder. 
## 2. How does this work?   

 -We are using official web app and adding Cumcord it with some other tweaks.   
## 3. Can I use this on other architectures or operating systems?

 -Yes! ArmCord should work normally under Windows, ~~Mac OS~~ (Mac OS is broken see [#48](https://github.com/ArmCord/ArmCord/issues/48)), Linux as long as it has NodeJS, npm and Electron support.   
## 4. Code is big spaghetti.

 -I'm aware. I'm slowly rewriting everything.
