ArmCord is a custom client designed to enhance your Discord experience while keeping everything lightweight. 

# Features

* **Standalone client** - ArmCord is built as standalone client, it doesn't rely on original Discord client.
* **Various mods built in** - Explore Cumcord/GooseMod/Flicker plugins and their features!
* **Made for Privacy** - ArmCord automatically blocks Discord's trackers.
* **Faster than normal Discord app** - ArmCord is using newer Electron than stock Discord app. This usually means increased performance and more stable experience.
* **Designed to work anywhere** - ArmCord was initially created in mind to run on Arm64 Linux devices. We soon expanded our support to more platforms. We plan to support every platform that [Electron supports](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/support#supported-platforms).

# FAQ
## 1.Will I get banned from using it?   

 -You are breaking Discord ToS if you decided to use client mods. But no one ever got banned from using ArmCord or any of the client mods included. If you wish to remove mods, check our documentation. 
## 2.How does this work?   

 -We are using official web app and adding some magic powder to make it all work!   
## 3.Can I use this on other architectures or operating systems?

 -Yes! ArmCord should work normally under Windows, ~~Mac OS~~ (Mac OS is broken see [#48](https://github.com/ArmCord/ArmCord/issues/48)) and Linux as long as it has NodeJS, npm and Electron support.
